```{r}
library(ggplot2)
paste0("This report was generated on " , Sys.Date()," at ", format(Sys.time(), "%H:%M"),".")
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
